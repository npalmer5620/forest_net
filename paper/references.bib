Clustering has proven to be an effective approach for organizing the network into a connected hierarchy. In this article, we highlight the challenges in clustering a WSN, discuss the design rationale of the different clustering approaches, and classify the proposed approaches based on their objectives and design principles. We further discuss several key issues that affect the practical deployment of clustering techniques in sensor network applications.},

  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) groups specialized transducers that provide sensing services to Internet of Things (IoT) devices with limited energy and storage resources. Since replacement or recharging of batteries in sensor nodes is almost impossible, power consumption becomes one of the crucial design issues in WSN. Clustering algorithm plays an important role in power conservation for the energy constrained network. Choosing a cluster head (CH) can appropriately balance the load in the network thereby reducing energy consumption and enhancing lifetime. This paper focuses on an efficient CH election scheme that rotates the CH position among the nodes with higher energy level as compared to other. The algorithm considers initial energy, residual energy, and an optimum value of CHs to elect the next group of CHs for the network that suits for IoT applications, such as environmental monitoring, smart cities, and systems. Simulation analysis shows the modified version performs better than the low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy protocol by enhancing the throughput by 60%, lifetime by 66%, and residual energy by 64%.},

  abstract = {The 1990s have seen a rapid growth of research interests in mobile ad hoc networking. The infrastructureless and the dynamic nature of these networks demands new set of networking strategies to be implemented in order to provide efficient end-to-end communication. This, along with the diverse application of these networks in many different scenarios such as battlefield and disaster recovery, have seen MANETs being researched by many different organisations and institutes. MANETs employ the traditional TCP/IP structure to provide end-to-end communication between nodes. However, due to their mobility and the limited resource in wireless networks, each layer in the TCP/IP model require redefinition or modifications to function efficiently in MANETs. One interesting research area in MANET is routing. Routing in the MANETs is a challenging task and has received a tremendous amount of attention from researches. This has led to development of many different routing protocols for MANETs, and each author of each proposed protocol argues that the strategy proposed provides an improvement over a number of different strategies considered in the literature for a given network scenario. Therefore, it is quite difficult to determine which protocols may perform best under a number of different network scenarios, such as increasing node density and traffic. In this paper, we provide an overview of a wide range of routing protocols proposed in the literature. We also provide a performance comparison of all routing protocols and suggest which protocols may perform best in large networks.}
